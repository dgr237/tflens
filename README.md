# tflens

A standalone Terraform analysis tool, written in Go. Parsing is delegated to [hashicorp/hcl/v2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) (the same library Terraform itself uses); the CLI layer uses [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). The analysis, diff, constraint, and module-resolution logic is implemented directly with no further runtime dependencies.

Parses `.tf` files, builds a dependency graph, validates references and types, and diffs two module versions to surface breaking changes. Does not execute Terraform and does not need provider schemas.

Optionally fetches module sources (Terraform Registry or git) on demand so downstream analysis can traverse into them — see [Module resolution](#module-resolution). Pass `--offline` to disable network fetches; local paths and `.terraform/modules/modules.json` entries are always resolved regardless.

## Install / build

```
make build           # produces ./tflens
make install         # installs into $(go env GOPATH)/bin
make check           # vet + fmt-check + test
make test            # tests only
make coverage        # produces coverage.html
make help            # list all targets
```

Or without make:

```
go build -o tflens .
go test ./...
```

Requires Go 1.25+. For network-mode module resolution (registry / git), `git` must also be available on `$PATH`.

Every subcommand has auto-generated help:

```
tflens --help
tflens validate --help
tflens diff --help
```

Shell completion scripts (bash / zsh / fish / PowerShell) are available via
`tflens completion <shell>`.

Global flags accepted on every subcommand:

- `--format json` — emit structured output on stdout; warnings stay on stderr as plain text, so stdout stays pipeable.
- `--format markdown` — emit GitHub-flavoured markdown on stdout (severity badges 🔴🟡🔵, collapsible `<details>` per module with the most-severe sections opened by default, code-fenced fix hints inline, file:line as inline backticks). Designed for sticky-commenting on PRs and GitHub Actions step summaries (`>> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`). Like `--format json`, the whole document is a single stream — warnings stay on stdout — so it can be piped directly into `gh pr comment`. Currently rich for `diff`/`whatif`/`statediff`/`validate`; other subcommands get a terse markdown rendering.
- `--offline` — disable registry and git fetches; only local paths and `.terraform/modules/modules.json` entries are resolved.

```
tflens --format json validate ./my-tf | jq '.cross_module_issues[]'
tflens --format markdown diff --ref main ./my-tf | gh pr comment $PR --body-file -
tflens --offline diff --ref main ./my-tf
```

## GitHub Action

A composite action wrapper lives at the repo root, so a workflow can invoke `tflens diff --format markdown --enrich-with-plan` and post the result as a sticky PR comment in one step:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write   # required for the sticky comment

jobs:
  tflens:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0   # tflens needs history for --ref comparison

      # Optional: produce a plan to enrich the diff with attribute-level deltas
      - run: terraform init && terraform plan -out=tfplan && terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json

      - uses: dgr237/tflens@v0.12.0
        with:
          command: diff
          ref: origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
          plan: plan.json
```

The action builds tflens from the same ref the consumer pinned (so `dgr237/tflens@v0.12.0` always runs tflens v0.12.0) and posts the markdown output as a sticky PR comment — subsequent runs edit the same comment via a hidden marker (`<!-- tflens-action:tflens -->`) instead of stacking new ones. Every run also appends to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` for visibility on the workflow run page.

Inputs (all optional):

| Input | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | `diff` | `diff` / `whatif` / `statediff` / `validate` |
| `path` | `.` | Project path |
| `ref` | `auto` | Git ref for diff/whatif/statediff. `auto` resolves to @{upstream} → origin/HEAD → main → master |
| `format` | `markdown` | `markdown` / `json` / `text`. PR commenting and step summary skip silently for non-markdown |
| `plan` | _(empty)_ | Path to `terraform show -json` output. Forwarded as `--enrich-with-plan` (diff only) |
| `state` | _(empty)_ | Path to a Terraform state file. Forwarded as `--state` (statediff only) |
| `args` | _(empty)_ | Raw extra args appended to the command (e.g. `--offline`) |
| `comment-on-pr` | `true` | Post / edit a sticky PR comment |
| `comment-tag` | `tflens` | Marker used to identify the sticky comment. Use distinct tags when calling the action multiple times in one workflow |
| `pr-number` | _(empty)_ | PR number to comment on. Required for non-`pull_request` triggers |
| `step-summary` | `true` | Append output to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` |
| `fail-on-breaking` | `true` | Exit non-zero when tflens reports findings (CI gate) |

Outputs: `output-file` (path to captured output), `exit-code` (numeric), `breaking` (`true` / `false`).

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `inventory <path>` | List all declared entities (variables, locals, resources, data sources, modules, outputs) with source locations |
| `deps <path> <id>` | Show what an entity depends on and what depends on it |
| `impact <path> <id>` | Show every entity transitively affected if `<id>` changes, in topological order |
| `unused <path>` | Report entities nothing else in the module references |
| `cycles <path>` | Detect and print dependency cycles; exits non-zero if any found |
| `graph <path>` | Emit the dependency graph in Graphviz DOT format |
| `fmt <file.tf>` | Print normalised HCL; `-w` rewrites in place, `--check` exits 1 when unformatted |
| `validate <path>` | Report undefined references, type errors, `for_each`/`count` misuse, and sensitive-value leaks |
| `diff [path]` | What changed in module APIs in `path` (default cwd) vs `--ref` (default `auto`)? Behaviour depends on the child's `source`: **local children** (`./…`, `../…`) are evaluated against your parent's actual usage (only consumption errors surface as Breaking — no API noise); **registry/git children** report the full API diff (publisher's release contract). Authors can also opt specific resource attributes into the diff with `# tflens:track` markers (engine versions, instance classes, …). With `--enrich-with-plan plan.json`, `terraform show -json` output is folded in so resource attribute changes (e.g. `cidr_block` modifications, force-new attributes) become visible alongside the static-analysis findings. |
| `whatif [path] [name]` | Like `diff` but **always** consumer-view, regardless of source type. Cross-validates the parent's argument set and output references against the candidate child; only flags changes that actually affect this caller. Use this to gate any external-module upgrade. Optional `name` scopes to one module call. |
| `statediff [path] [--state file]` | Static hazard detector: resource adds/removes vs `--ref` (default `auto`), plus locals whose value changed and whose dep chain reaches `count`/`for_each`. With `--state`, lists the state instances that may be affected |
| `cache info` | Show the cache location, entry count, and total size |
| `cache clear` | Delete every cached module |
| `export [path]` | **[EXPERIMENTAL]** Emit the enriched module model as JSON — variables/outputs/resources with type info, evaluated values where statically resolvable, dependency graph, tracked-attribute markers. Shape subject to change; intended as a building block for converters to other provisioning systems (kro, crossplane, Pulumi, etc.). See [Export (experimental)](#export-experimental). |

`<path>` is either a single `.tf` file or a directory (in which case all `.tf` files in it are merged into a single module view, matching Terraform's own behaviour).

## Parsing coverage

Parsing is delegated to `hashicorp/hcl/v2` (`hclparse` + `hclsyntax`), so the full Terraform HCL2 surface is supported, including:

- Blocks with labels (`resource "aws_vpc" "main" { ... }`)
- Attributes and nested blocks, including `dynamic` blocks
- All primitive literals (string, number, bool, null), heredocs
- Template strings with `${...}` interpolation and `$$` literal-dollar escapes
- Expressions: unary/binary operators with correct precedence, ternary `?:`, splat (`.*`, `[*]`), indexing, dot traversal
- Collections: tuples, objects with `=` or `:` separators
- `for` expressions for both lists and maps, with optional `if` clause
- Function calls (with `...` argument spread)

Parse errors are reported with position information (`file:line:column`). The `fmt` command runs `hclwrite.Format`, which preserves comments and blank lines.

## Validation (`validate`)

### What it catches

**Undefined references:**
- `var.X` referencing an undeclared variable
- `local.X` referencing an undeclared local
- `module.X` referencing an undeclared module call
- `data.X.Y` referencing an undeclared data source

**Type errors on variable defaults:**
- `variable "x" { type = number, default = "three" }` — default type mismatches declared type
- Object field types, including `optional(T)` wrapping, are compared structurally
- `any` accepts everything; `null` defaults are always permitted

**Meta-argument misuse:**
- `for_each` must be a map, set, or object literal; passing a list (including via `keys()`, `values()`, `concat()`, etc.) is flagged
- `count` must not be a list/set/map/object/bool literal
- Variable references in these positions are resolved to their declared types when available

**Builtin function return types:**
- A registry of roughly 80 common functions (string, numeric, collection, encoding, hash, networking, file/path, predicate) feeds the type inference. `for_each = keys(var.tags)` is flagged because `keys` returns a list.

**Sensitive propagation:**
- An output whose `value` references a `sensitive = true` variable but is not itself marked `sensitive` — Terraform rejects this at plan time.

**Cross-module inputs (when target is a directory):**
- A `module "x" { source = "..." ... }` call that omits a required child variable (one with no `default`) is flagged.
- An argument passed via the module block that has no matching variable in the child is flagged as an unknown argument.
- When the argument's type is inferable (literal, built-in function return, or `var.X` with a declared type) and the child variable has a declared type, incompatible types are flagged.
- Recursion is transitive: root → middle → leaf modules are all cross-checked.

See [Module resolution](#module-resolution) below for how `source = "..."` is turned into a directory on disk.

A broken `modules.json` is reported as a warning but does not abort the rest of the validation.

### What it does NOT catch

- **Resource-style references** (`aws_vpc.main.id`) to undeclared resources. This is deliberate: `for` expressions introduce unbound iterator variables (`item`, `v`, `k`, ...) and treating every unknown two-part reference as an undefined resource produces too many false positives without scope-aware analysis.
- **Function argument types.** Only return types are modelled. Passing the wrong type *into* a function is not flagged (Terraform will catch it at plan time with higher fidelity than we could).
- **Provider attribute types.** The shape of `aws_vpc.main.cidr_block` depends on the AWS provider schema, which this tool does not embed.
- **Condition semantics not *evaluated*.** `validation { condition = ... }`, `precondition`, and `postcondition` blocks have their condition text captured and diffed (adding/removing/replacing a condition surfaces as Informational), but the boolean isn't evaluated — so we can't tell you whether `length(var.x) > 5` would pass for a given input value, nor whether one constraint is strictly broader/narrower than another.
- **`count` with string literals.** Terraform silently coerces `"3"` to `3`, so we allow it.
- **Cross-module validation in `--offline` mode for unresolved remote sources.** When `--offline` is set, parent → child checks require the child's directory to be resolvable — either via a local path (`./x`, `../y`) or via the post-`terraform init` manifest at `.terraform/modules/modules.json`. Registry and git sources cannot be loaded in that mode and are silently skipped. Either run `terraform init` first or drop `--offline`.
- **Cross-module validation where argument types are opaque.** A parent passing `aws_vpc.main.cidr_block` to a typed child variable produces no type-mismatch error because the resource attribute's type cannot be resolved without provider schemas.
- **Runtime values.** Defaults that call `timestamp()`, `uuid()`, or similar are not evaluated.
- **Build metadata in semver.** Stripped during parsing per SemVer 2.0.0 §10. Prerelease identifiers are preserved and ordered per §11 (via `hashicorp/go-version`, the same library Terraform uses).

## Diff (`diff`)

```
tflens diff [path] [--ref <base>]
```

`path` defaults to cwd; `--ref` defaults to `auto` (resolves to `@{upstream}` → `origin/HEAD` → `main` → `master`). The command diffs the **root module** (the directory at `path`) and pairs every child module call between the two trees by dotted key (e.g. `vpc.sg`).

The root module gets a full API diff — adding a required variable, removing an output, changing the backend, etc. all show up under a `Root module:` section. The operator running `terraform plan` against this directory IS the consumer, even though no parent calls the root.

For child module calls, the classification depends on **how the child is sourced**:

- **Local children** (`source = "./…"` or `"../…"`) — internal to this repo. Their API is implementation detail; only the parent's actual consumption is observable. `diff` runs cross-validation of the new parent against the new child and reports a Breaking change only when the parent's usage is broken (passes an unknown arg, fails to pass a now-required input, or references a removed `module.<name>.<output>`). Renaming a variable that the parent updated atomically is silent.
- **Registry / git children** — published by someone else (or by you, in a release). The publisher owns breaking-change discipline. `diff` reports the full API diff (every variable / output / type / lifecycle change) classified as Breaking, NonBreaking, or Informational. A removed variable shows up regardless of whether your specific parent passed it.

Both modes exit non-zero when any Breaking changes exist (suitable for CI gating).

Classifications used for registry/git children:

- **Breaking** — existing callers or state will be affected
- **NonBreaking** — safe to upgrade through
- **Informational** — operational or cosmetic, but worth surfacing

### Fix hints

Most breaking changes carry a one-line `hint:` with the conventional fix. Example:

```
Module "vpc": (content changed)
  Breaking (1):
    variable.region: required variable added (no default)
      hint: add `default = ...` to make it optional, or document that callers must set it
```

Hints cover the common cases: required-variable-added (suggest `default`), required-object-field-added (suggest `optional()`), resource removed/renamed (suggest `removed {}` / `moved {}` blocks with the exact entity IDs filled in), backend changes (`terraform init -migrate-state`), `count`↔`for_each` transitions, sensitive-leak removals on outputs, and the four cross-validate consumption errors. The JSON output emits the same string under a `"hint"` key (omitted when empty).

### Plan enrichment (`--enrich-with-plan plan.json`)

`tflens diff` is fundamentally a static analyser — it doesn't embed provider schemas, so changes to resource attributes (`cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"` → `"10.1.0.0/16"`, `instance_type` modifications, force-new attribute changes) are normally invisible. The `--enrich-with-plan` flag bridges that gap by reading the JSON output of `terraform show -json <plan>` and folding plan-derived attribute deltas into the diff result alongside the static-analysis findings.

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan && terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json
tflens diff --ref main --enrich-with-plan plan.json
```

**Classification:** force-new attributes (those Terraform marks in the plan's `replace_paths`) become Breaking; other attribute changes become Informational; resource creates become Informational; resource deletes and explicit replaces (destroy + recreate) become Breaking. The CI exit code refreshes to include plan-derived Breaking findings — so a plan-only force-new change still gates the merge even when the source-side text doesn't differ.

**Provenance:** plan-derived rows are tagged with a `[plan]` prefix in the console renderer and a 📋 marker in the markdown renderer, so reviewers can tell at a glance which findings came from static analysis vs the plan output.

**Sensitive value redaction.** Attributes flagged via the plan's `before_sensitive` / `after_sensitive` shadow trees (anything that flowed through a sensitive variable, sensitive output, or `sensitive = true` resource attribute) render as `(sensitive)` instead of the raw value. Subtree-wide markers (e.g. an entire `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.secret_string` map flagged sensitive) collapse to a single `(sensitive)` row at the subtree level rather than descending into placeholder children. This is enforced inside `pkg/diff/enrich.go` before the value reaches Detail — no renderer downstream can accidentally leak it.

**`(known after apply)` rendering.** Attributes whose post-apply value is computed by the provider (the plan's `after_unknown` shadow) render as `(known after apply)` rather than `<nil>`, so `aws_db_instance.main:arn` showing `→ (known after apply)` is unambiguously "the provider will fill this in" rather than "the attribute is being unset".

**Per-module routing.** Plan-derived rows whose module address matches a paired module call land under that pair's section in the rendered output, next to the static-side findings for the same module. Plan rows for unmatched modules (or for the root) accumulate in the project-root section. Indexed module addresses (`module.regions["us-east-1"]`) route to the underlying `module.regions` pair regardless of how many instances the for_each / count produces.

```
Root module:
  Breaking (2):
    [plan] aws_vpc.main: plan replaces `aws_vpc.main` (destroy + recreate)
    [plan] aws_vpc.main:cidr_block: plan attribute change: "10.0.0.0/16" → "10.1.0.0/16"
      hint: this attribute forces a destroy + recreate; coordinate with the operator
```

**Source positions.** When a plan ResourceChange matches a known source-side entity, the entity's source position (`file:line`) is propagated onto the resulting Change so the markdown renderer can link plan-derived rows back to the resource declaration. Plan rows for resources NOT in the source-side analysis (typical of stale plans) leave the position empty rather than fabricating one — they're already marked with the `(no matching source-side entity — plan may be stale)` hint.

**Stale `moved {}` block detection.** When the source declares `moved { from = X; to = Y }` AND the plan still shows X as a delete plus Y as a create, the pair is collapsed into a single Informational entry hinting that the plan is stale and should be regenerated. (When the plan correctly honours the moved block, terraform emits a no-op / update at the new address rather than delete+create — those flow through unchanged.) Currently scoped to resource/data renames; module-call renames are deferred.

**First-cut limitations** (worth knowing before you wire this into CI):

- **`count`/`for_each` instances all roll up to the same source-side entity.** Plan addresses like `aws_subnet.foo[0]` / `aws_subnet.foo["us-east-1"]` resolve to the single source-side `resource.aws_subnet.foo` declaration (matching by index-stripped path), but each indexed instance still gets its own Change row with the full plan address — including the index — preserved in the Subject. So `aws_subnet.foo[0]:cidr_block` and `aws_subnet.foo[1]:cidr_block` are visually distinct in the output. Indexed module calls (`module.regions["us-east-1"]`) match the same way: the source-side `module.regions` ModuleNode is the lookup target regardless of how many instances the for_each / count produces.
- **Plan format versions.** Supports format_version 1.x (Terraform 1.0+). Older plans are rejected with a clear error.
- **`whatif --enrich-with-plan`** layers plan-derived findings onto each call's API-changes section so reviewers see the full picture per call. Plan rows whose module address has no matching call are dropped silently — whatif is per-call only; use `tflens diff --enrich-with-plan` for root-level coverage. Plan-derived Breaking findings count toward the CI exit code in addition to DirectImpact.
- **`statediff --enrich-with-plan`** pairs the static "this count/for_each expression COULD recompute" signal with the plan's "here are the N concrete instances that WILL be affected." Each `AffectedResource` gets a `PlanInstances` list with the per-instance plan addresses (including count/for_each indices) and the actions terraform will take (`["update"]`, `["delete", "create"]`, etc.). Resources with no plan match leave `PlanInstances` empty — possible reasons: count expanded to 0, plan is stale, or the resource isn't in the plan.

### What it catches

**Variables:**

| Change | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| Variable removed | Breaking |
| New required variable (no default) | Breaking |
| New optional variable (has default) | NonBreaking |
| `default` removed (optional → required) | Breaking |
| `default` added (required → optional) | NonBreaking |
| Type widened — every old value is still acceptable (`string` → `any`, `list(string)` → `list(any)`, `map(T)` → `map(any)`, …; backed by `cty.Convert`) | NonBreaking |
| Type narrowed — some old values are now rejected (`any` → `string`, `list(any)` → `list(string)`, …) | Breaking |
| Type changed and incompatible (unrelated shapes) | Breaking |
| Existing default still converts cleanly to the new type (emitted alongside the type change so callers using the default see they're unaffected) | Informational |

| Object field added (optional) | NonBreaking |
| Object field removed | Breaking |
| Object field optional → required | Breaking |
| Object field required → optional | NonBreaking |

**Outputs:**

| Change | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| Output removed | Breaking |
| Output added | NonBreaking |
| `sensitive = true` added | Informational |
| `sensitive = true` removed (sensitive leak — value previously masked is now exposed) | Breaking |
| `ephemeral = true` added (Terraform 1.10+) | Breaking |
| `ephemeral = true` removed | NonBreaking |
| Output value type narrowed or incompatible (inferred via `var.X` → declared type, function-return tables, or constant evaluation; e.g. `string` → `list(string)` from `[for ...]`) | Breaking |
| `value` expression changed but inferred type compatible (or types unknown) | Informational |
| Referenced `local` expression changed (indirect, surfaced when the output expression text is unchanged) | Informational |
| `precondition` / `postcondition` block added or removed (compared by canonical condition text — reordering is a no-op) | Informational |
| `depends_on` changed | Informational |

**Resources, data sources, module calls:**

| Change | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| Entity removed | Breaking |
| Entity added | Informational |
| Rename detected (1:1 same kind+type, 1 removed + 1 added) | Breaking ("possible rename") |
| `moved { from = X, to = Y }` block covering the pair | Informational ("rename handled") |
| `removed { from = X }` block covering a deletion | Informational ("removal handled") |
| `count` ↔ `for_each` transition (either direction) | Breaking |
| `count` / `for_each` added to or removed from a singleton | Breaking |
| `for_each` *key type* narrowed or incompatible (e.g. `set(string)` → `set(number)` — every instance is re-addressed under a different key; also fires when the for_each text is unchanged but a referenced variable's type narrowed underneath) | Breaking |
| `for_each` *expression* changed but key type compatible (or unknown) | Informational |
| `count` *expression* infers as a non-number type (e.g. `var.n` retyped from `number` to `list(string)`) — Terraform will reject the plan | Breaking |
| `count` *expression* changed but stays numeric (or type unknown) | Informational |
| `provider = aws.east` → `aws.west` | Breaking |
| Lifecycle: `prevent_destroy` added/removed | Informational |
| Lifecycle: `create_before_destroy` toggled | Informational |
| Lifecycle: `ignore_changes = all` narrowed to a list (drift detection now fires on attributes that were previously suppressed) | Breaking |

| Module `version` constraint changed (semver-aware, below) | Breaking / NonBreaking / Informational |
| Module argument (non-meta-arg attribute) added/removed/value-changed | Informational |

**`terraform {}` block:**

| Change | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| `required_version` constraint change (semver-aware) | Breaking / NonBreaking / Informational |
| `required_providers` entry added | Breaking |
| `required_providers` entry removed | NonBreaking |

| `backend` type changed (`s3` → `azurerm`, etc.) | Breaking |
| `backend` config attribute added, removed, or value changed (state may relocate) | Breaking |

**Semver-aware version constraint comparison:**

Version constraints (`>= 1.0`, `~> 4.0`, `!= 1.2.3`, compound forms like `">= 1.0, < 2.0"`) are parsed into interval sets and compared:

- **Equal** — same satisfying set
- **Broadened** (old ⊂ new) — NonBreaking
- **Narrowed** (new ⊂ old) — Breaking ("tightened")
- **Overlap** (neither subset, some overlap) — Breaking ("partially narrowed")
- **Disjoint** — Breaking ("incompatible")
- **Unparseable** — falls back to Informational with a generic detail

### What it does NOT catch

- **Resource attribute body changes.** A resource gaining or changing an attribute (`cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"` → `"10.1.0.0/16"`) is not diffed by default. The noise-to-signal ratio of a full body diff is too low; if the resource is removed, renamed, or has its meta-arguments changed, we flag that. Authors can opt specific attributes into the diff with the [`# tflens:track`](#tracked-attributes-for-application-development-teams) marker — used for engine versions, instance classes, and **force-new attributes** (`cluster_name`, `identifier`, …) where a change quietly forces a destroy and recreate.
- **Resource provider schema changes.** We cannot tell that an AWS provider bump from v4 to v5 silently changed `aws_vpc.main.cidr_block` from a string to a list, because we do not embed provider schemas.
- **Dynamic block content.** `dynamic "ingress" { for_each = ... }` bodies generate blocks at plan time. Without evaluating the `for_each`, the generated block set is opaque.
- **Condition strictness.** If `validation { condition = length(var.x) > 0 }` becomes `condition = length(var.x) > 5`, we record that a validation block exists in both versions but cannot tell that the new condition rejects strictly more inputs.
- **Default value *content* changes.** Only the presence or absence of a default is diffed by default. Changing `default = "dev"` to `default = "prod"` produces no change — most real modules change defaults deliberately, and flagging every edit produces too much noise. When the variable is referenced from a tracked attribute (`# tflens:track`), the default is followed and changes to it ARE flagged against the tracked attribute.
- **Description / documentation changes.** Informational-only, currently skipped.
- **Ambiguous renames.** The rename heuristic pairs exactly one removed entity with one added entity of the same kind and type. When there are multiple candidates (two removed, two added of the same type), no pairing is attempted — each is reported individually.
- **Type coercion subtleties.** `list(string)` → `set(string)` is flagged as a type change. Terraform auto-converts in some expression contexts but not others (index access `[0]` fails on sets); distinguishing safe from unsafe coercions requires knowing how each caller uses the variable, which is cross-module.
- **Type narrowing of custom objects without `optional()`.** Adding a field to an object type is correctly flagged as breaking, but this tool cannot reason about *what* the provider would accept for that field's value.
- **`check { assert { ... } }` blocks** (Terraform 1.5+) — not currently parsed.
- **`import { ... }` blocks** (Terraform 1.5+) — not currently parsed.
- **Provisioner blocks** (`provisioner "local-exec"`, `connection`) — not currently parsed; their presence or absence affects teardown and creation but is not flagged.
- **Nested moved-block expressions with indices.** `moved { from = aws_vpc.main[0], to = aws_vpc.main["a"] }` is not recognised; only bare resource references in `from` / `to` are parsed.
- **Children that cannot be resolved offline.** `diff`, `whatif`, and `statediff` only compare children that both resolvers can materialise. In `--offline` mode or against registry/git sources missing from the cache and from `.terraform/modules/modules.json`, the child is skipped rather than reported.

## What-if upgrade analysis (`whatif`)

`whatif` is the **consumer view**: it answers *if I merged the working tree's module changes, would my parent still work?*

```
tflens whatif [path] [module-call-name] [--ref <base>]
```

For every module call in `path` (default cwd) that differs between the working tree and the base ref (default `auto` → `@{upstream}` → `origin/HEAD` → `main` → `master`), `whatif` loads the parent at base, loads the candidate child from the working tree, and reports:

1. **Direct impact:** cross-validation of the parent's `module "<name>" { ... }` block against the candidate — missing required inputs, unknown arguments, and type mismatches the upgrade would introduce.
2. **Module API changes:** the full `diff` between the base and working-tree child, for context.

With an optional `module-call-name`, scope to one call. Exits non-zero when the direct-impact list is non-empty (suitable for CI gating).

This is strictly more focused than `diff`. A child module can ship many "Breaking" API changes that don't affect a particular caller — e.g. removing a variable the parent never passed, or tightening a type the parent's value already satisfies. `whatif` cross-validates the parent's argument set against the candidate child's variables and only flags changes that *actually break this caller*.

### `whatif` vs `diff`

Both compare the path against a git base. After the source-type rules above, they overlap on local-source children — both ask "does the parent's usage still work?". The difference is on **registry / git children**:

| Child source | `diff` | `whatif` |
|---|---|---|
| Local (`./…`, `../…`) | Consumer view (cross-validate parent vs new child) | Consumer view (same) |
| Registry / git | Author view (full API diff classified by API-shape rules) | Consumer view (cross-validate parent vs new child; suppresses changes that don't affect this caller) |

In CI:

- `tflens diff` for the broad question "anything changed I should know about?" — quiet on local internals you've updated atomically, loud on registry-module API drift.
- `tflens whatif` when you want to gate a PR strictly on "will this break MY usage?" — quiet on every module-call upgrade that your parent absorbs cleanly, regardless of how the child is sourced.

## State-level hazard detection (`statediff`)

```
tflens statediff [path] [--ref <base>] [--state state.json]
```

`path` defaults to cwd; `--ref` defaults to `auto`.

A static hazard detector for PRs that may unintentionally add, destroy, or re-instance resources. It answers: *if I merge this branch, which of my state's resource instances are at risk?*

It reports:

- **Resource identity adds and removes** — every `resource "TYPE" "NAME"` declaration that appears in one branch but not the other. A missing declaration is the most direct path to a destroy.
- **Renames via `moved {}` blocks** — a `moved { from = aws_vpc.old, to = aws_vpc.new }` block in the new tree that pairs a real removal with a real addition is recognised as a rename, listed separately, and does NOT contribute to the exit code (Terraform handles the rename without destroy/recreate).
- **Sensitive value changes** — locals OR variable defaults whose expression changed between branches, whose dependency chain reaches a `count` or `for_each` meta-argument. This is the silent class of bug: trim a list in `locals { regions = [...] }` (or drop `variable "n" { default = 3 }` to `1`) and a resource that expands from that value quietly loses instances. No attribute in the resource block itself changed — tools that only diff resource blocks miss it.
- **State cross-reference** — when `--state state.json` is given, every flagged resource is annotated with the instances currently in state. A reviewer sees concrete addresses (`aws_instance.web["us-west-2"]`) rather than abstract warnings.
- **State orphans** — addresses in state that have no corresponding declaration in the working tree. These indicate pre-existing drift and are reported separately; they do NOT contribute to the exit code since they are not caused by this PR.

Exit code is 1 when any resource add/remove or sensitive local fires.

### What it does not do

- **Plan simulation.** Attribute-level diffs (`cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"` → `"10.1.0.0/16"`) need provider schemas and expression evaluation — that is `terraform plan`'s job. `statediff` is a complementary, cheap, schema-free check that catches a different class of hazard than plan.
- **Full expression evaluation.** A curated subset of Terraform built-ins is wired in (see [Static evaluation surface](#static-evaluation-surface) below), so e.g. `count = length(local.xs)` IS evaluated when `local.xs` is statically known. But anything that reaches a data source, a computed resource attribute, or a non-curated function still falls back to "may change". The signal is a warning, not a definitive answer.
- **Variable-driven changes across module callers.** A `count = var.n` resource where the caller on one branch passes `n = 3` and the other passes `n = 1` is not currently followed across module boundaries.

## Tracked attributes (for application-development teams)

`diff` deliberately ignores most resource-block attribute changes — they're noise relative to the public API surface (variables, outputs, types). But some attributes are load-bearing for *operations*. Two broad classes are worth pulling out:

- **In-place but disruptive** — an EKS `cluster_version` bump, an RDS `engine_version` jump, an EC2 `instance_class` resize. The resource is updated in place but the change has real-world consequences (downtime, add-on compatibility, cost).
- **Force-new (destroy + recreate)** — an EKS `cluster_name`, an RDS `identifier`, an `aws_db_subnet_group.name`. Terraform's plan will show `# forces replacement` for these, but only after `terraform plan` runs against an applied state. At PR-review time the diff looks like an innocent string change. Worse, the value is usually computed (`"${var.env}-${local.suffix}"`), so the literal text in the resource block doesn't change at all when `local.suffix` flips from `"primary"` to `"secondary"`.

These are easy to merge by accident and hard to roll back. AD teams own the resource modules; they're the people who know which attributes need a second pair of eyes.

Mark them with `# tflens:track`:

```hcl
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "this" {
  name            = "prod"
  cluster_version = "1.28" # tflens:track: bump only after add-on compatibility check
}
```

Now `tflens diff` flags any change to `cluster_version` as **Breaking**, with the comment text surfaced as the hint.

### Marker placement

| Form | Where it goes | Annotates |
|---|---|---|
| Trailing | Same line as the attribute, after the value | The attribute on that line |
| Own-line | On its own line, immediately above the attribute | The attribute on the next line |

Both `#` and `//` comment styles work. The text after `tflens:track:` is free-form — keep it short and operational; it appears verbatim in the diff hint.

```hcl
# Trailing
cluster_version = "1.28" # tflens:track: requires planned maintenance window

# Own-line — useful when the value is long
# tflens:track: requires planned maintenance window
cluster_version = "1.28"
```

A bare `# tflens:track` (no description) is also valid; the diff still flags changes, just without a custom hint.

### Indirection through variables and locals

Real modules rarely hard-code these values. The marker follows indirection one or two hops deep:

```hcl
variable "cluster_version" {
  type    = string
  default = "1.28"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["1.28", "1.29", "1.30"], var.cluster_version)
    error_message = "version must be a supported EKS minor"
  }
}

resource "aws_eks_cluster" "this" {
  cluster_version = var.cluster_version # tflens:track
}
```

A change to `var.cluster_version`'s `default` is detected and reported as Breaking against the tracked attribute, with the variable's ID in the message. The same applies to `local.foo`, including chains (`local.outer = local.inner = "1.28"`) — the resolver recurses with cycle protection.

Combine with a `validation { condition = contains([...], var.cluster_version) }` block for two layers of safety: tflens flags the change at PR time, Terraform itself rejects unsupported values at plan time.

#### Force-new attributes with computed values

The indirection rule extends to string interpolation, which is where force-new attributes usually hide. Consider:

```hcl
variable "env" {
  type    = string
  default = "prod"
}

locals {
  suffix = "primary"
}

resource "aws_eks_cluster" "this" {
  # cluster_name is force-new — changing this destroys and recreates the cluster
  cluster_name = "${var.env}-${local.suffix}" # tflens:track: force-new — destroys and recreates the cluster
}
```

If a teammate changes `local.suffix = "secondary"` in a follow-up PR, the literal text of `cluster_name` is unchanged — the resource block looks identical between branches. But the *computed* value flips from `"prod-primary"` to `"prod-secondary"`, and Terraform will plan a destroy + recreate. tflens follows the interpolated `var.env` and `local.suffix` references and reports:

```
resource.aws_eks_cluster.this.cluster_name: local.suffix changed: "primary" → "secondary"
  hint: force-new — destroys and recreates the cluster
```

Same mechanism, different operational risk profile — and the marker description (the text after `tflens:track:`) is the right place to communicate that risk to reviewers.

### Why removing the marker is itself flagged

If a teammate decides to "just remove the comment" to avoid the diff, that's exactly the failure mode the marker exists to prevent. Marker removal is reported as a Breaking change of its own:

```
resource.aws_eks_cluster.this.cluster_version: tracked-attribute marker removed (the safety guard is gone)
  hint: restore the `# tflens:track` comment, or remove the attribute entirely if the resource is gone
```

Adding a new marker is reported as Informational on its own — but if the underlying value also moved in the same PR (the common "I'm calling out this specific change" flow), it's promoted to Breaking with the old → new value shown:

```
local.cluster_version.value: tracked-attribute marker added; value "1.34" → "1.35"
  hint: EKS minor — bump only after add-on compatibility check
```

So you can introduce both the marker and the breaking change in one PR and still gate CI on the result.

### Where to put the marker

Pick the highest-leverage spot for your scenario:

- **Resource attribute** in the module that owns the resource — `cluster_version = "1.28" # tflens:track`. Catches direct edits to the literal AND changes to any `var.X` / `local.X` referenced in the value. Best for self-contained modules.
- **Locals block** in the parent that decides the value — `locals { cluster_version = "1.34" # tflens:track }`. Best when the local is the source of truth and the value is consumed by one or more module calls. Each local becomes its own tracked entity (`local.<name>.value`), and the indirection walker still resolves any `var.X` it references.
- **Module call argument** in the parent — `module "eks" { cluster_version = local.cluster_version # tflens:track }`. Best when the value flows through a parent that you own but the child is a third-party module. The walker follows the local back to its definition + any vars referenced inside.

**Cross-module resolution:** when `tflens diff` runs against a project that contains module calls, a marker in a child module is also resolved through the parent's call argument. A marker on `cluster_version = var.cluster_version # tflens:track` *inside a child module* will catch a parent-side change like `local.cluster_version` being made conditional or a new variable's default flowing in — the diff climbs through the parent's `module "<name>" { cluster_version = ... }` argument and walks any locals/vars it transitively references on the parent's side. Parent-side refs appear in the diff output prefixed with `parent.` so reviewers can tell which side of the boundary moved.

**Effective-value awareness:** when the literal text of an expression changes but it evaluates to the same constant (e.g. `"1.34"` on the old side vs `var.upgrade ? "1.35" : "1.34"` with `var.upgrade = false` on the new side, both yielding `"1.34"`), the diff suppresses the value-change detail. The marker still surfaces *what's new* (a freshly-referenced variable, for example) as Informational supporting context — useful for reviewers to know what's wired in — but won't gate CI as Breaking unless the effective value actually moved.

Evaluation goes through known variable defaults and local values via the cty stdlib plus a curated set of ~46 Terraform built-ins (`length`, `contains`, `merge`, `lookup`, `concat`, `toset`, `lower`, `format`, `replace`, `sort`, `coalesce`, `min`/`max`, … — see [Static evaluation surface](#static-evaluation-surface) for the full list and what's deliberately out). Expressions that can't be evaluated statically — references to `data.X.Y` data sources, computed resource attributes (`aws_vpc.main.id`), or any non-curated function — fall back to literal text comparison. That fallback is conservative: if the texts differ, the diff is reported as Breaking even when the *real* value might be unchanged, because tflens can't prove either way without resolving the unevaluable bits. Expressions where text and effective value both differ on the new side are always reported correctly; expressions where text differs but value doesn't are only collapsed when both sides evaluate cleanly.

### Where it works

- **Root module** — annotated attributes in any `.tf` file at the project root are diffed against the same path at the base ref.
- **Child modules** — every module call (recursively) is also covered, regardless of source type. Local-source children get tracked diffing in addition to consumption checks; registry/git children get it in addition to the full API diff.

Tracked-attribute diffs always count toward the `tflens diff` exit code, so CI gates work without extra wiring.

## Export (experimental)

> **Status: prototype.** The output shape is explicitly versioned (`schema_version` field) and flagged `_experimental: true` in every emitted document. **Do not depend on field stability across minor versions until this graduates** — entries may be added, renamed, or restructured in response to feedback from downstream converter authors.

```
tflens export [path]
```

`path` defaults to cwd. Walks the project tree (root + all resolvable child modules) and emits a single JSON document containing the enriched entity model that tflens has built up internally:

- **Unified expression shape.** Every field that holds an HCL expression — resource attributes, `count`, `for_each`, `depends_on`, lifecycle (`ignore_changes`, `replace_triggered_by`), module-call arguments, locals, outputs, variable defaults — emits as `{text, value?, ast?}`: `text` is the canonical source, `value` is the cty-marshalled JSON when the curated stdlib resolves the expression, and `ast` is the structural decomposition as a tagged JSON tree (`function_call`, `scope_traversal`, `binary_op`, `conditional`, `for`, `splat`, `object_cons`, …) so non-Go consumers can translate expressions without re-parsing the text. Tracked-attribute records (`# tflens:track` markers) emit only `expression_text` — they're diff-machinery (the canonical text is what powers the breaking-change detector), not converter input, so the text-only shape is appropriate.
- **Per module**: variables (parsed type + default expression + sensitivity flags + structured `validations` list, each with `condition` and optional `error_message` as expressions), outputs (value expression + sensitivity + `preconditions`/`postconditions` lists), resources + data sources (every meta-arg + per-attribute map + recursive `blocks` map for nested blocks like EKS's `vpc_config { ... }` / `encryption_config { provider { key_arn = ... } }`; repeated blocks like `ingress { ... } × N` come back as a list of instances in source order; **`dynamic_blocks` map** alongside `blocks` for `dynamic "name" { for_each = ..., iterator = ..., content { ... } }` constructs — the for_each expression, iterator name, and recursive content body are all surfaced so converters can translate to the target system's iteration primitive; **`preconditions`/`postconditions` lists** on every resource/data with full condition + error_message expressions), locals (value expression), module calls (source, version, count/for_each, full argument map), the `terraform { }` block (required version, required providers, backend type, **`providers` list of every top-level `provider "X" { alias = "...", ... }` instance with its per-attribute config**), and `# tflens:track` markers.
- **Dependency graph**: adjacency map of canonical entity IDs.
- **Project tree**: child modules nested under `root.children.<call-name>` recursively, with the original `source` string preserved.

Evaluated values come through the curated stdlib (see [Static evaluation surface](#static-evaluation-surface)) — anything that resolves statically (literals, variable defaults, `format`/`jsonencode`/`lower`/etc. of known constants, transitive var/local refs) gets an `evaluated_value` populated with both the cty type and the JSON value. Anything that reaches a computed attribute, data source, or non-curated function omits `evaluated_value` and surfaces only `value_text` — converters can choose what to do with unevaluable expressions.

### Why it exists

Downstream tools that translate Terraform configurations into other provisioning systems (kro, crossplane, Pulumi, CDK for Terraform, …) all need the same upstream work: parse the HCL, infer types, resolve cross-module references, evaluate what's statically resolvable, build the dependency graph. tflens has all of that already. `export` makes it accessible without each converter re-implementing the parser/analyser layers.

`hashicorp/hcl`'s parser output gives you the raw AST — fine if you want literal source bytes, but you'd still need to do the type inference and cross-module work yourself. `terraform show -json` gives you the fully-evaluated plan — but it requires provider credentials, real state, and provider schemas, which static converters don't want to deal with. `tflens export` sits between: schema-free, providerless, no plan required, but with the type and dependency information that raw HCL doesn't surface.

### Worked example

Three end-to-end POCs consume the export JSON and emit different target shapes. The orthogonality of orchestration layer × managed-resource provider is deliberate — picking different combinations validates that the export schema isn't implicitly shaped to any one target:

| POC | Orchestration | Managed Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`docs/export-to-kro-rgd/`](./docs/export-to-kro-rgd/) | kro RGD | ACK (`<service>.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1`) |
| [`docs/export-to-crossplane/`](./docs/export-to-crossplane/) | Crossplane Composition + XRD | Upbound provider-aws (`<service>.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1`) |
| [`docs/export-to-kro-crossplane/`](./docs/export-to-kro-crossplane/) | kro RGD | Upbound provider-aws |

Comparing them shows the same export JSON producing very different shapes:

- Variable refs become **CEL `${schema.spec.X}` substitutions** (kro POCs) or **declarative `patches` with `fromFieldPath`** (Crossplane POC).
- Cross-resource refs become **`${resources.foo.status.<convention>.arn}` traversals** (kro) or **explicit `ResourceRef` / `MatchControllerRef` policy** (Crossplane).
- `format()` calls become **CEL string concat** (kro) or a **`transforms: [{type: string, ...}]` patch entry** (Crossplane).
- Dynamic blocks become **CEL `.map()` inline** (kro) or **Composition Functions** (Crossplane, TODO).
- ARN paths follow the target's convention: ACK puts it at `status.ackResourceMetadata.arn`, Upbound at `status.atProvider.arn`.

The two kro POCs (ACK vs Upbound) are 95% identical — ~50 LOC of mapping-table and constant deltas separate them. That isolation is the schema's job, and the existence of three POCs validates it works as intended. Each bundled README documents the translation model, subtleties, and effort estimates for productionisation.

### Shape stability

The shape is versioned via the `schema_version` field. While `_experimental: true`, fields may be added, renamed, or restructured between minor releases. We'll bump `schema_version` whenever the shape changes (even additions) so consumers can detect drift cheaply. When the prototype graduates, `_experimental` flips to `false` and the schema becomes part of the stable API contract under SemVer.

### Not yet emitted

Adding fields is cheap; reverting them after they ship is expensive — so a couple of items are still deferred until a converter author actually needs them:

- **`lifecycle`** is deliberately not in either `blocks` or `dynamic_blocks`. Its meta-arg attributes are already projected into dedicated parent-resource fields (`prevent_destroy`, `create_before_destroy`, `ignore_changes`, `replace_triggered_by`) — surfacing the block again would just duplicate. Lifecycle's nested `precondition`/`postcondition` blocks ARE surfaced, just under the parent resource's `preconditions`/`postconditions` field rather than nested inside a `lifecycle` block.

If you're building a converter and need a different shape, please open an issue — the shape conversation is exactly what the experimental phase exists for.

## Module resolution

Commands that traverse a project (`validate`, `diff`, `whatif`, `statediff`) turn each `module "x" { source = "..." }` call into a directory on disk via a chain of resolvers, tried in order:

1. **Local path** — `source = "./x"` and `source = "../y"` resolve relative to the caller's directory. Always tried.
2. **`.terraform/modules/modules.json`** — if the manifest produced by `terraform init` is present, every module call is resolved through it by dotted key path (`vpc`, `vpc.sg`, etc.). Always tried.
3. **Terraform Registry** — sources of the form `ns/name/provider` or `host/ns/name/provider` (plus optional `//subdir`). Service discovery (`/.well-known/terraform.json`) → version list → `version` constraint (`~>`, `>=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`) resolved to a concrete version → tarball or git download → extracted into the cache. Skipped in `--offline` mode.
4. **Git** — `source = "git::<url>"` (HTTPS, SSH, or file:// for tests) plus the bare VCS shorthand `github.com/foo/bar`, `bitbucket.org/foo/bar`, `gitlab.com/foo/bar`, `codeberg.org/foo/bar`. Honours `?ref=` and `//subdir`. Skipped in `--offline` mode.

### Cache

Downloaded modules are stored under the OS user cache directory (e.g. `~/.cache/tflens/modules` on Linux, `%LocalAppData%\tflens\modules` on Windows). The cache is content-addressable and immutable: a given (host, path, concrete-version) tuple is only ever downloaded once. Delete the directory to force re-fetches.

### Private registries

Credentials are read from two sources, in this order:

1. **TFE tokens YAML file**, opt-in via `$TFLENS_TFE_TOKENS_FILE`. Some Terraform Enterprise org-management tooling ships per-organisation tokens in this format:

   ```yaml
   tokens:
     - address: tfe.example.com
       token: your-tfe-token
     - address: https://other.tfe.example.com
       token: another-tfe-token
   ```

   `address` may be a bare host, a `host:port` pair, or a full URL — only the host (with port if non-default) is matched against the outgoing request. Loading is strictly opt-in: with `$TFLENS_TFE_TOKENS_FILE` unset, tflens never reads from any conventional path. Set the variable to enable the source.

2. **Terraform CLI config file** (`$TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`, or `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` on Windows, or `~/.terraformrc` elsewhere) — the standard Terraform format:

   ```
   credentials "app.terraform.io" {
     token = "your-api-token"
   }

   credentials "registry.example.com" {
     token = "..."
   }
   ```

When both files name the same host, the TFE-tokens entry wins (it's typically org-managed and more authoritative than a personal CLI config). Either source missing is fine; running with neither falls through to anonymous access.

Bearer tokens are sent **only** to requests whose `URL.Host` exactly matches a configured entry. This means a registry that redirects its tarball download URL at a third-party CDN (typical for GitHub-backed public modules) never receives the token.

### Version constraints

`~>`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `=`, `!=` are supported, comma-separated clauses are intersected. Version comparison follows SemVer 2.0.0, including prerelease precedence (§11). Prerelease matching is currently mathematical: `1.5.0-beta` satisfies `>= 1.0.0`.

## Fundamental limitations

These are not bugs but deliberate boundaries:

- **No Terraform execution.** This is a static analyser. Anything that requires planning, applying, or querying a provider is out of scope.
- **No provider schemas.** We do not embed AWS/GCP/Azure/etc. provider schemas. Resource attribute types, required-vs-optional attributes, and deprecations of resource types are invisible to us. Running `terraform validate` in addition to this tool catches those.
- **Limited expression evaluation.** Conditionals, arithmetic, string interpolation, and a curated set of ~46 Terraform built-in functions (see [Static evaluation surface](#static-evaluation-surface)) ARE evaluated when every reference resolves to a known constant — this powers the effective-value-collapse for tracked attributes and statediff sensitive locals. Anything that reaches a computed attribute (`aws_vpc.main.id` is always `TypeUnknown`), a data source, or a non-curated function (`templatefile`, `jsondecode`, `regex`, `try`, …) falls back to text comparison.
- **Caller awareness only at module-call boundaries.** `whatif` and the local-source path of `diff` cross-validate a parent module's `module "x" { ... }` block against the candidate child's variables and outputs. Beyond that — e.g. whether some external repo that pinned to an old version still works after a registry-module change — is out of scope; we'd need to analyse those callers too.
- **Mid-expression comments are dropped.** Line and block comments at statement boundaries round-trip correctly; comments embedded inside a function call argument list split across lines, or inside a multi-line object/tuple literal, are lost by `fmt`.

### Static evaluation surface

Tracked-attribute diffs and statediff sensitive-local detection both ask the question "does the new expression evaluate to the same value as the old one?". When the answer is yes, the change is suppressed — so a refactor like `"us-east-1"` → `lower("US-EAST-1")` doesn't gate CI.

The curated function set is intentionally a subset of Terraform's built-ins, not a complete mirror. Adding more is cheap (one entry in `pkg/analysis/stdlib/stdlib.go` plus a fixture) — see [issue #16](https://github.com/dgr237/tflens/issues/16) for the rationale on what's in vs. out.

| Group | Functions |

**Deliberately excluded** (and unlikely to be added): filesystem (`file`, `fileset`, `templatefile`) — needs filesystem context that isn't valid for static analysis; non-deterministic (`timestamp`, `uuid`, `bcrypt`) and time-based hashing (`base64sha256`, `base64sha512`, `filebase64sha256`, `md5`, `sha1`, etc.) — must always return unknown or need crypto state that isn't pure-functional; complex semantics (`can`, `try`) — needs full Terraform evaluator catch-and-retry; `regexreplace` — Terraform exposes regex replacement only through the `/pattern/` form of `replace`, which the curated `replace` already dispatches; date/time helpers (`formatdate`, `timeadd`) — input is usually `timestamp()` (excluded) and standalone uses are rare; rarely-used numerics (`signum`, `log`) — almost never seen in real modules.

## Editor integration

For HCL syntax/intellisense use HashiCorp's [`terraform-ls`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) with the official VS Code / IntelliJ / Neovim extensions — it ships with provider schemas (knows that `aws_vpc.cidr_block` is a string, etc.), which tflens deliberately does not embed.

tflens itself is CLI- and CI-shaped: run `validate` / `diff` / `whatif` / `statediff` / `inventory` to surface the analyses that are unique to it (cross-module input checks, semver-aware version constraint diffs, sensitive-value propagation, state-impact prediction).

## Architecture

Code is organised under `pkg/`:

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | Source-position type (thin wrapper over `hcl.Pos`) used across the API |
| `analysis` | Entity collection, dependency graph, type system, validation, graph algorithms (cycles, topo-sort, impact, unreferenced); consumes `hclsyntax.Body` from `pkg/loader` |
| `loader` | Multi-file / directory / recursive submodule loading via `hclparse`, cross-module input validation |
| `diff` | Two-module comparison with semver-aware constraint classification; expression equality goes through `hclwrite.Format` so whitespace-only edits don't show as changes |
| `cache` | Content-addressable disk cache for downloaded module sources |
| `resolver` | Pluggable `Resolver` chain (local path, `.terraform/modules/modules.json`, Terraform Registry, git) with credential support |
| `tfstate` | Terraform state v4 JSON parser; exposes resource identity + instance keys for cross-reference |

The CLI layer lives in top-level `cmd/` (cobra), with one file per subcommand. `main.go` just calls `cmd.Execute()`.

The analysis is a three-pass design: collect entities → collect dependency edges → run type checking. The dependency graph powers `deps`, `impact`, `unused`, `cycles`, and the topological-sort output in `impact`.
